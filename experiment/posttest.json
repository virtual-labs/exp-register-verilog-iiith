      "question": "In the Verilog implementation of a SISO register, what is the purpose of the non-blocking assignment (<=)?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "To perform arithmetic operations",
        "b": "To ensure sequential behavior in the always block",
        "c": "To create combinational logic",
        "d": "To generate clock signals"
      },
      "correctAnswer": "b",
      "difficulty": "intermediate",
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Non-blocking assignments are not used for arithmetic operations",
        "b": "Correct! Non-blocking assignments ensure proper sequential behavior by evaluating all right-hand sides before making assignments",
        "c": "Combinational logic typically uses blocking assignments (=)",
        "d": "Clock signals are generated separately, not through assignments"
      }

    {
      "question": "What is the delay between input and output in a 4-bit SISO register?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "1 clock cycle",
        "b": "2 clock cycles",
        "c": "3 clock cycles",
        "d": "4 clock cycles"
      },
      "correctAnswer": "d",
      "difficulty": "intermediate",
      "explanations": {
        "a": "This would be true for a 1-bit register",
        "b": "This would be true for a 2-bit register",
        "c": "This would be true for a 3-bit register",
        "d": "Correct! A 4-bit register has a 4-clock cycle delay as data moves through each flip-flop"
      }
    },
    {
      "question": "What happens to the data in a SISO register when the reset signal is active?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Data continues to shift normally",
        "b": "All bits are set to 1",
        "c": "All bits are cleared to 0",
        "d": "The register stops responding to the clock"
      },
      "correctAnswer": "c",
      "difficulty": "intermediate",
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Reset overrides normal operation",
        "b": "Reset typically clears the register to 0, not 1",
        "c": "Correct! The reset signal clears all bits to 0 in the register",
        "d": "The register still responds to the clock, but maintains 0 during reset"
      }

    {
      "question": "Which Verilog construct is used to implement the sequential behavior of a register?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "initial block",
        "b": "always @(posedge clk) block",
        "c": "assign statement",
        "d": "function declaration"
      },
      "correctAnswer": "b",
      "difficulty": "intermediate",
      "explanations": {
        "a": "initial blocks are used for testbenches, not sequential logic",
        "b": "Correct! The always @(posedge clk) block implements sequential behavior triggered by clock edges",
        "c": "assign statements are used for combinational logic",
        "d": "functions are used for reusable code, not sequential behavior"
      }

    {
      "question": "What is the main advantage of using a SISO register over a parallel register?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Faster data transfer",
        "b": "Fewer input/output pins required",
        "c": "Higher storage capacity",
        "d": "Lower power consumption"
      },
      "correctAnswer": "b",
      "difficulty": "advanced",
      "explanations": {
        "a": "SISO registers are actually slower as they transfer one bit at a time",
        "b": "Correct! SISO registers require fewer pins as data is transferred serially",
        "c": "The storage capacity is the same for both types of registers",
        "d": "Power consumption is not the primary advantage of SISO registers"
      }
