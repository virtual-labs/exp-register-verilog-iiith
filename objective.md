1. To demonstrate the practical implementation of Serial In Serial Out 4-bit Registers using the Verilog hardware description language.

2. To enable learners to simulate and analyze the behavior of registers using software tools.

3. To foster a deeper understanding of how registers can be used to build more complex circuits and how to code in Verilog.
